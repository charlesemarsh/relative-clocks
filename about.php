  		<p>Relative Clocks is artwork by Chomko &amp; Rosier
			commissioned by the UK Space Agency.</p>

			<p>The Relative Clocks are a representation of time
			dilation, the effect of general and special relativity
			on the flow of time.</p>

			<p>A series of four, each Relative Clock represents
			a single spacecraft, indicating how far back or
			forward in time the spacecraft have travelled since
			their launch.</p>

			<p>The clocks seek to ground the complex theories of
			relativity, making tangible their real effect.</p>

			<p>The clocks were first exhibited at Decima X in
			London, November 2016. The Clocks are now
			available for touring and exhibiting.</p>

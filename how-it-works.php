  		<p>Spacecraft orbiting the earth experience time at a
			different rate than us on Earth, due to the effects
			of gravity and velocity on the flow of time. This
			effect is known as <a href="">time dilation</a>, and is explained
			by Albert Einsteinâ€™s theories of relativity.</p>

			<p>The front hand of the clock displays the time on a
			spacecraft, while the rear hand displays the time
			on Earth.</p>

			<p>The delay between the tick of the front and
			rear hands indicates the actual time difference
			between Earth and the spacecraft.</p>

			<p>This difference is constantly growing, as each
			second on the spacecraft is slightly longer or
			shorter than a second on earth.</p>

			<p>The clocks update every day to reflect the
			constant effects of relativity on the spacecraft.</p>

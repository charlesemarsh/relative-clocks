  		<p>The data was created by taking into account both
			gravitational and velocity time dilation, and was
			calculated to a tolerance of 10 milliseconds over
			the whole calculation period, which corresponds to
			an average uncertainty of 0.02%.</p>

			<p>The calculation takes into account the location of
			the Relative Clocks, the difference in earth radius
			at a given latitude, and the elliptical orbits of the
			satellites.</p>

			<p>The calculation does not take into effect the
			sunâ€™s gravitational field, gravitational waves,
			foreign objects entering into orbit, solar winds, or
			quantitative acceleration at launch.</p>

			<p>The data was prepared by Tom Vaughan, PhD
			Candidate, Royal Holloway, University of London,
			and Chris Haynes, PhD Candidate, University of
			Hertfordshire.</p>
